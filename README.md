## Cheat codes

There's no point for you to just copy-paste password into ssh connections, since you wouldn't
learn a single thing so I guess I can just put them here. I need to save my progression somewhere anyway.

### Login in
To connect using SSH use: `ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
  > it becomes `ssh banditx@localhost` once you're already connected
