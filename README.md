# Hacking Games
![README's image header](binary-hacking.png)

I wanted to learn more about security, so I decided to start doing hacking games exercises
also known as CRACKMEs, CTFs, etc. apparently.

# WarGames

* [OverTheWire's website](http://overthewire.org)
* current level: [from bandit 4 to 5](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

## Cheat codes

There's no point for you to just copy-paste password into ssh connections, since you wouldn't
learn a single thing so I guess I can just put them here. I need to save my progression somewhere anyway.

### Login in
To connect using SSH use: `ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
  > it becomes `ssh banditx@localhost` once you're already connected

### From level N to N + 1

This isn't a proper hacking game exercises website, but I had a hard time finding MOOCs
or courses about binary hacking and this guy's videos helped me a lot to get started.
